# Body Measurement Application

## Introduction
The **Body Measurement Application** is designed to automate the extraction of body measurements from a user-uploaded image. This project leverages image processing techniques to measure attributes like height, wrist size, chest width, leg length, arms, and hip size, and stores the results in a structured database. The application is ideal for use in industries such as fashion, fitness, and healthcare, providing a digital solution for accurate body measurements, note this application is not yet accurate.

This application uses **Flask** as the backend framework, and **MySQL** for database management via SQLAlchemy ORM. Users can register, upload images, and receive their body measurements instantly.
